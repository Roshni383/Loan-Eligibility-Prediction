# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
Vision:
The goal of this project is to predict the eligibility of individuals for loans based on certain attributes. By employing machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees and Naive Bayes, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether an individual is eligible for a loan or not. This model can be beneficial for financial institutions in automating the loan approval process, thereby saving time and resources while minimizing the risk of defaults.

Step-by-Step Process:

Data Cleaning:

The first step involves cleaning the dataset to ensure it is ready for training the machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

Data Preprocessing:

Once the data is clean, preprocess it by splitting it into features (independent variables) and the target variable (loan eligibility).
Perform any necessary feature scaling or normalization to ensure that all features have a similar scale.

Model Selection:

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task of loan eligibility prediction. In this project, we have chosen Decision Trees and Naive Bayes.
Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and how they apply to the problem at hand.

Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
Train the selected machine learning models using the training data.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Compare the performance of Decision Trees and Naive Bayes models based on their prediction accuracy.

Model Tuning (Optional):

If necessary, tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve their performance. This can be done using techniques such as cross-validation or grid search.

Final Model Selection:

Based on the evaluation results, select the best-performing model for predicting loan eligibility.

Deployment:

Once the final model is selected, deploy it into production where it can be used to predict loan eligibility for new applicants.
Integrate the model into the loan approval process of financial institutions to automate the decision-making process.
By following these steps, we aim to build a robust and accurate loan eligibility prediction system that can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions while processing loan applications.
